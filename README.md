# Binary Bingo
## Project Description
Binary Bingo is a fun and educational game created by the WRHS Computer Science Honors Society that combines the excitement of bingo with the logic of binary numbers. This game is designed to help players understand binary numbers in a fun and engaging way.

## How to Play
Each player is given a bingo card filled with Base 10 numbers. A caller will randomly generate binary numbers, which players have to convert to Base 10. If a player has that number on their card, they can mark it off. The first player to mark off a complete row or column wins!

## Installation
To install Binary Bingo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/EliChapman/binary-bingo`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd binary-bingo`
3. Install the required dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
To start the game, run the following command in your terminal: `npm start`. Pressing the `Generate` button will generate a binary number and the `Show Answer` button will display the generated number in Base 10. All rolled numbers will be saved to the `Called Numbers` element and you can reset the list with the `Reset` Button. Only numbers 1-75 will be called in accordance with standard Bingo proceedure.
